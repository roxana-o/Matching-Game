# Matching Game – *Descoperă Timișoara* (*Discover Timisoara*)
## What are Matching Games?
Matching Games require players to match similar elements. These games can improve visual memory, concentration level, analytical thinking skills, patience, and are a great way to spend your time. 

## Why is this game different?
The elements that the players have to match are photos of interesting places from Timisora, such as *The Banat Village Museum*, *The Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral*, *Liberty Square*, *The Romanian National Opera Timisoara*, *Bega River*, *Timisoreana Beer Factory*, and others. In this way, you can find out more about Timisoara and its beautiful tourist attractions. It is not a coincidence that the game is called *Descoperă Timișoara* (*Discover Timisoara*).

## Instructions
